=head1 NAME

OSSP::uuid - B<OSSP uuid> Perl Binding

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<OSSP::uuid> is the Perl binding to the B<OSSP uuid> API.

B<OSSP uuid> is an ISO-C and Perl application programming interface
(API) and corresponding command line interface (CLI) for the generation
of DCE 1.1 and ISO/IEC 11578:1996 compliant I<Universally Unique
Identifier> (UUID). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1 (time
and node based), version 3 (name based) and version 4 (random number
based).

B<OSSP::uuid> provides two Perl APIs:

=head2 OO-STYLE API

The OO-style API is a wrapper around the C-style API and intended for
high-level and regular programming.

=item C<use OSSP::uuid;>

=item C<my $uuid = >B<new>C< OSSP::uuid;>

=item C<$uuid-E<gt>>B<load>C<($name);>

=item C<$uuid-E<gt>>B<make>C<($mode, ...);>

=item C<$result = $uuid-E<gt>>B<isnil>C<();>

=item C<$result = $uuid-E<gt>>B<compare>C<($uuid2);>

=item C<$uuid-E<gt>>B<import>C<($fmt, $data_ptr);>

=item C<$data_ptr = $uuid-E<gt>>B<export>C<($fmt);>

=item C<[(]$str[, $rc)] = $uuid-E<gt>>B<error>C<();>

=item C<$ver = $uuid-E<gt>>B<version>C<();>

=item C<undef $uuid;>

=back

Additionally, the strings C<"v1">, C<"v2">, C<"v3"> and C<"mc"> can be
used in C<$mode> and the strings C<"bin">, C<"str">, and C<"txt"> can be
used for C<$fmt>.

=head2 C-STYLE API

The C-style API is a direct mapping
of the B<OSSP uuid> ISO-C API to Perl and is intended for low-level
programming. See uuid(3) for a description of the functions and
their expected arguments.

=over 4
 
=item C<use OSSP::uuid qw(:all);>

=item C<my $uuid; $rc = >B<uuid_create>C<($uuid);>

=item C<$rc = >B<uuid_load>C<($uuid, $name);>

=item C<$rc = >B<uuid_make>C<($uuid, $mode, ...);>

=item C<$rc = >B<uuid_isnil>C<($uuid, $result);>

=item C<$rc = >B<uuid_compare>C<($uuid, $uuid2, $result);>

=item C<$rc = >B<uuid_import>C<($uuid, $fmt, $data_ptr, $data_len);>

=item C<$rc = >B<uuid_export>C<($uuid, $fmt, $data_ptr, $data_len);>

=item C<$str = >B<uuid_error>C<($rc);>

=item C<$ver = >B<uuid_version>C<();>

=item C<$rc = >B<uuid_destroy>C<($uuid);>

=back

Additionally, the following constants are exported for use in C<$rc>, C<$mode>, C<$fmt> and C<$ver>:

C<UUID_VERSION>,
C<UUID_LEN_BIN>,
C<UUID_LEN_STR>,
C<UUID_RC_OK>,
C<UUID_RC_ARG>,
C<UUID_RC_MEM>,
C<UUID_RC_SYS>,
C<UUID_RC_INT>,
C<UUID_RC_IMP>,
C<UUID_MAKE_V1>,
C<UUID_MAKE_V3>,
C<UUID_MAKE_V4>,
C<UUID_MAKE_MC>,
C<UUID_FMT_BIN>,
C<UUID_FMT_STR>,
C<UUID_FMT_TXT>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following two examples create the version 3 UUID
C<02d9e6d5-9467-382e-8f9b-9300a64ac3cd>, both via the OO-style and the
C-style API. Error handling is omitted here for easier reading, but has
to be added for production-quality code.

  #   OO-style API (high-level)
  use OSSP::uuid;
  my $uuid    = new OSSP::uuid;
  my $uuid_ns = new OSSP::uuid;
  $uuid_ns->load("ns:URL");
  $uuid->make("v3", $uuid_ns, "http://www.ossp.org/");
  undef $uuid_ns;
  my $str = $uuid->export("str");
  undef $uuid;
  print "$str\n";

  #   C-style API (low-level)
  use OSSP::uuid qw(:all);
  my $uuid;    uuid_create($uuid);
  my $uuid_ns; uuid_create($uuid_ns);
  uuid_load($uuid_ns, "ns:URL");
  uuid_make($uuid, UUID_MAKE_V3, $uuid_ns, "http://www.ossp.org/");
  uuid_destroy($uuid_ns);
  my $str; uuid_export($uuid, UUID_FMT_STR, $str, undef);
  uuid_destroy($uuid);
  print "$str\n";
