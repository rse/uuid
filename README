  OSSP uuid - Universally Unique Identifier
  Version 1.1.1 (18-Nov-2004)

  ABSTRACT

  OSSP uuid is a ISO-C and Perl application programming interface (API)
  and corresponding command line interface (CLI) for the generation of
  DCE 1.1 and ISO/IEC 11578:1996 compliant Universally Unique Identifier
  (UUID). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1 (time and node
  based), version 3 (name based) and version 4 (random number based).

  UUIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high likelihood
  of uniqueness over space and time and are computationally difficult
  to guess. They are globally unique identifiers which can be locally
  generated without contacting a global registration authority. UUIDs
  are intended as unique identifiers for both mass tagging objects
  with an extremely short lifetime and to reliably identifying very
  persistent objects across a network.
