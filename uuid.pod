=head1 NAME

B<OSSP uuid> - B<Universally Unique Identifier>

=head1 VERSION

OSSP uuid UUID_VERSION_STR

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<OSSP uuid> is a ISO-C application programming interface (API) and
corresponding command line interface (CLI) for the generation of DCE
1.1 and ISO/IEC 11578:1996 compliant I<Universally Unique Identifier>
(UUID). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1 (time and node
based), version 3 (name based) and version 4 (random number based).

UUIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high likelihood
of uniqueness over space and time and are computationally difficult
to guess. They are globally unique identifiers which can be locally
generated without contacting a global registration authority. UUIDs
are intended as unique identifiers for both mass tagging objects
with an extremely short lifetime and to reliably identifying very
persistent objects across a network.

This is the ISO-C application programming interface (API) of B<OSSP uuid>.

=head2 UUID Binary Representation

According to the DCE 1.1 and ISO/IEC 11578:1996 standards, a DCE 1.1
variant UUID is a 128 bit number defined out of 7 fields, each field a
multiple of an octet in size and stored in network byte order:

  0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 0|                          time_low                             |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 1|       time_mid                |         time_hi_and_version   |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 2|clk_seq_hi_res |  clk_seq_low  |         node (0-1)            |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 3|                         node (2-5)                            |
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

An example of a UUID binary representation is the octet stream "C<0xEC
0xB9 0xF3 0x5F 0x44 0x2A 0x11 0xD8 0x8A 0x24 0x00 0x90 0x27 0x2F 0xF7
0x25>". The binary representation format is exactly what the B<OSSP uuid>
API functions B<uuid_pack>() and B<uuid_unpack>() deal with.

=head2 UUID ASCII String Representation

According to the DCE 1.1 and ISO/IEC 11578:1996 standards, a DCE
1.1 variant UUID is represented as an ASCII string consisting
of 8 hexadecimal digits followed by a hyphen, then three groups
of 4 hexadecimal digits each followed by a hyphen, then 12
hexadecimal digits. Formally, the string representation is defined by
the following grammar:

 uuid                   = <time_low> "-" <time_mid> "-"
                          <time_high_and_version> "-"
                          <clock_seq_and_reserved>
                          <clock_seq_low> "-" <node>
 time_low               = 4*<hex_octet>
 time_mid               = 2*<hex_octet>
 time_high_and_version  = 2*<hex_octet>
 clock_seq_and_reserved = <hex_octet>
 clock_seq_low          = <hex_octet>
 node                   = 6*<hex_octet>
 hex_octet              = <hex_digit> <hex_digit>
 hex_digit              = "0"|"1"|"2"|"3"|"4"|"5"|"6"|"7"|"8"|"9"
                         |"a"|"b"|"c"|"d"|"e"|"f"
                         |"A"|"B"|"C"|"D"|"E"|"F"

An example of a UUID string representation is the ASCII string
"C<54531d28-402b-11d8-af12-0002a5094c23>". The string representation
format is exactly what the B<OSSP uuid> API functions B<uuid_parse>() and
B<uuid_format>() deal with.

=head2 UUID Variants and Versions

A UUID has a variant and version. The variant defines the layout of the
UUID. The version defines the content of the UUID. The UUID variant
supported in B<OSSP uuid> is the DCE 1.1 variant only. The DCE 1.1 UUID
variant versions supported in B<OSSP uuid> are:

=over 4

=item B<Version 1> (time and node based)

These are the classical UUIDs, created out of a 60-bit system time,
a 14-bit local clock sequence and 48-bit system MAC address. The MAC
address can be either the real one of a physical network interface card
(NIC) or a random multi-cast MAC address. Version 1 UUIDs are usually
used as one-time global unique identifiers.

=item B<Version 3> (name based)

These are UUIDs which are based on the 128-bit MD5 message digest of the
concatenation of a 128-bit namespace UUID and a name string of arbitrary
length. Version 3 UUIDs are usually used for non-unique but repeatable
message digest identifiers.

=item B<Version 4> (random data based)

These are UUIDs which are based on just 128-bit of random data. Version
4 UUIDs are usually used as one-time local unique identifiers.

=back

=head2 UUID Uniqueness

Version 1 UUIDs are guaranteed to be unique through combinations of
hardware addresses, time stamps and random seeds. There is a reference
in the UUID to the hardware (MAC) address of the first network interface
card (NIC) on the host which generated the UUID -- this reference
is intended to ensure the UUID will be unique in space as the MAC
address of every network card is assigned by a single global authority
(IEEE) and is guaranteed to be unique. The next component in a UUID
is a timestamp which, as clock always (should) move forward, will
be unique in time. Just in case some part of the above goes wrong
(the hardware address cannot be determined or the clock moved steps
backward), there is a random clock sequence component placed into the
UUID as a "catch-all" for uniqueness.

Version 3 UUIDs are guaranteed to be inherently globally unique if the
combination of namespace and name used to generate them is unique.

Version 4 UUIDs are not guaranteed to be globally unique, because they
are generated out of locally gathered pseudo-random numbers only.
Nevertheless there is still a high likelihood of uniqueness over space
and time and that they are computationally difficult to guess.

=head2 Nil UUID

There is a special I<Nil> UUID consisting of all octets set to zero in
the binary representation. It can be used as a special UUID value which does
not conflict with real UUIDs.

=head1 APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE

The ISO-C Application Programming Interface (API) of B<OSSP uuid>
consists of the following components.

=head2 CONSTANTS

The following constants are provided:

=over 4

=item B<UUID_LEN_BIN>, B<UUID_LEN_STR>

The number of octets of the UUID binary and string representations.
Notice that the lengths of the string representation does I<not> include
the necessary C<NUL> termination character.

=item B<UUID_VERSION1>, B<UUID_VERSION3>, B<UUID_VERSION4>, B<UUID_MCASTRND>

The I<mode> bits for use with B<uuid_make>(). The
B<UUID_VERSION>I<N> specify which UUID version to generate. The
B<UUID_MCASTRND> forces the use of a random multi-cast MAC address
instead of the real physical MAC address in version 1 UUIDs.

=item B<UUID_RC_OK>, B<UUID_RC_ARG>, B<UUID_RC_MEM>, B<UUID_RC_SYS>, B<UUID_RC_INT>

The possible numerical return-codes of API functions.
Use B<uuid_error>() to translate them into string versions.

=item B<UUID_FMT_BIN>, B<UUID_FMT_STR>, B<UUID_FMT_TXT>

The I<fmt> formats for use with B<uuid_import>() and B<uuid_export>().
The B<UUID_FMT_BIN> indicates the UUID binary representation (of
length B<UUID_LEN_BIN>), the B<UUID_FMT_STR> indicates the UUID string
representation (of length B<UUID_LEN_STR>) and the B<UUID_FMT_TXT>
indicates the textual description (of arbitrary length) of a UUID.

=back

=head2 FUNCTIONS

The following functions are provided:

=over 4

=item uuid_rc_t B<uuid_create>(uuid_t **I<uuid>);

Create a new UUID object and store a pointer to it in C<*>I<uuid>.
A UUID object consists of an internal representation of a UUID, the
internal PRNG and MD5 generator contexts, and cached MAC address and
timestamp information. The initial UUID is the I<Nil> UUID.

=item uuid_rc_t B<uuid_destroy>(uuid_t *I<uuid>);

Destroy UUID object I<uuid>.

=item uuid_rc_t B<uuid_isnil>(uuid_t *I<uuid>, int *I<result>);

Checks whether the UUID in I<uuid> is the I<Nil> UUID.
If this is the case, it returns I<true> in C<*>I<result>.
Else it returns I<false> in C<*>I<result>.

=item uuid_rc_t B<uuid_compare>(uuid_t *I<uuid>, uuid_t *I<uuid2>, int *I<result>);

Compares the order of the two UUIDs in I<uuid1> and I<uuid2>
and returns the result in C<*>I<result>: C<-1> if I<uuid1> is
smaller than I<uuid2>, C<0> if I<uuid1> is equal to I<uuid2>
and C<+1> if I<uuid1> is greater than I<uuid2>.

=item uuid_rc_t B<uuid_import>(uuid_t *I<uuid>, uuid_fmt_t I<fmt>, const void *I<data_ptr>, size_t I<data_len>);

Imports a UUID I<uuid> from an external representation of format I<fmt>.
The data is read from the buffer at I<data_ptr> which contains at least
I<data_len> bytes.

The format of the external representation is specified by I<fmt> and the
minimum expected length in I<data_len> depends on it. Valid values for
I<fmt> are B<UUID_FMT_BIN> and B<UUID_FMT_STR>.

=item uuid_rc_t B<uuid_export>(uuid_t *I<uuid>, uuid_fmt_t I<fmt>, void **I<data_ptr>, size_t *I<data_len>);

Exports a UUID I<uuid> into an external representation of format I<fmt>.
The data is written to the buffer at C<*>I<data_ptr> which has room
for at least C<*>I<data_len> bytes. If C<*>I<data_ptr> is C<NULL>,
a new buffer is allocated (and I<data_len> ignored as input). If
I<data_len> is not C<NULL>, the number of written bytes are stored into
C<*>I<data_len>.

The format of the external representation is specified by I<fmt> and the
minimum required length in C<*>I<data_len> depends on it. Valid values
for I<fmt> are B<UUID_FMT_BIN>, B<UUID_FMT_STR> and B<UUID_FMT_TXT>.

=item uuid_rc_t B<uuid_load>(uuid_t *I<uuid>, const char *I<name>);

Loads a pre-defined UUID value into the UUID object I<uuid>. The
following I<name> arguments are currently known:

=over 4

=item I<name>      I<UUID>

=item nil       00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

=item ns:DNS    6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8

=item ns:URL    6ba7b811-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8

=item ns:OID    6ba7b812-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8

=item ns:X500   6ba7b814-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8

=back

The "C<ns:>I<XXX>" are names of pre-defined name-space UUIDs for use in
the generation of DCE 1.1 version 3 UUIDs.

=item uuid_rc_t B<uuid_make>(uuid_t *I<uuid>, unsigned int I<mode>, ...);

Generates a new UUID in I<uuid> according to I<mode> and optional
arguments (dependent on I<mode>).

If I<mode> contains the C<UUID_VERSION1> bit, a DCE 1.1 variant UUID of
version 1 is generated. Then optionally the bit C<UUID_MCASTRND> forces
the use of random multi-cast MAC address instead of the real physical
MAC address (the default). The UUID is generated out of the 60-bit current
system time, a 12-bit clock sequence and the 48-bit MAC address.

If I<mode> contains the C<UUID_VERSION3> bit, a DCE 1.1 variant UUID
of version 3 is generated and two additional C<NUL>-terminated string
arguments of type "C<const char *>" are expected: first a namespace,
given as an internally pre-defined id (currently known are ids "C<DNS>",
"C<URL>", "C<OID>", and "C<X500>") or a UUID in string representation.
Second, a name string of arbitrary length. The UUID is generated out of
the 128-bit MD5 from the concatenated octet stream of namespace UUID and name
string.

If I<mode> contains the C<UUID_VERSION4> bit, a DCE 1.1 variant UUID
of version 4 is generated. The UUID is generated out of 128-bit random
data.

=item char *B<uuid_error>(uuid_rc_t I<rc>);

Returns a constant string representation corresponding to the
return-code I<rc> for use in displaying B<OSSP uuid> errors.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE

The following shows an example usage of the API. Error handling is
omitted for code simplification and has to be re-added for production
code.

 /* generate a DCE 1.1 v1 UUID from system environment */
 char *uuid_v1(void)
 {
     uuid_t *uuid;
     char *str = NULL;

     uuid_create(&uuid);
     uuid_make(uuid, UUID_VERSION1);
     uuid_export(uuid, UUID_FMT_STR, (void **)&str, NULL);
     uuid_destroy(uuid);
     return str;
 }

 /* generate a DCE 1.1 v3 UUID from an URL */
 char *uuid_v3(const char *url)
 {
     uuid_t *uuid;
     uuid_t *uuid_ns;
     char *str = NULL;

     uuid_create(&uuid);
     uuid_create(&uuid_ns);
     uuid_load(uuid_ns, "ns:URL");
     uuid_make(uuid, UUID_VERSION3, uuid_ns, url);
     uuid_export(uuid, UUID_FMT_STR, (void **)&str, NULL);
     uuid_destroy(uuid_ns);
     uuid_destroy(uuid);
     return str;
 }

=head1 HISTORY

B<OSSP uuid> was implemented in January 2004 by Ralf S. Engelschall
E<lt>rse@engelschall.comE<gt>. It was prompted by the use of UUIDs
in the B<OSSP as> and B<OpenPKG> projects. It is a clean room
implementation intended to be strictly standards compliant and maximum
portable.
